# Capstone

Software Development Capstone SNHU Brief explanation of directories: "src original" and "src original minimal" are the original code with the minimal directory including only files that were updated. If you wish to compile and run the application you will need the entire "src original" directory to be functional. src enhanced and src minimal enhanced are the updated files fully incorporated and error free. The "src minimal enhanced" directory includes the only files that were updated. Once again if you want to run the application, you will need the entire contents of the "src enhanced" folder.
